<!-- in surge, this could be one of the default languages Angular app, but the better solution is to read cookie and redirect -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
 <script>
  const cookie = document.cookie;
  let root = 'en';
  // use any cookie name, redirect according to value
  if (cookie.indexOf('cr-lang') > -1) {
    // this line was produced by CoPilot! Not bad!
    root = cookie.split('cr-lang=')[1].split(';')[0];
  }
  // replace URL, a client 301 redirect
  window.location.replace(`/${root}`);
